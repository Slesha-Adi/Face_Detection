# Face_Detection
Project uses OPENCV with Python to detect faces in photos.
We make use cv2, matplotlib and numpy libraries to read and display the image.
A pre-defined haar cascade training file is loaded and used to train the program to detect faces.
The faces are then highlighted with red rectangles displaying that the output was acuurate.
I was able to learn and explore Haar cascades and the various methods available in cv2 library.
