# Face_Detection
This project uses OPENCV with Python to detect faces in photos. 
We use cv2, matplotlib and numpy libraries to read and display the image.
A haar cascade training file is loaded and used to train the program to detect faces.
The faces are then highlighted with red rectangles displaying that the output was accurate.
I was able to learn and explore Haar cascades and the various methods available in cv2 library and get familiar with datasets and training.
